# Host Runner (Guarded)

Generated by the host bootstrap adapter.

Files:

- `/root/RALF/.ralf-host/config/host-runner.env` - environment defaults for a future local runner
- `/root/RALF/.ralf-host/bin/ralf-host-runner` - helper wrapper for guarded local runner execution

Current behavior:

- `--check`: validates local prerequisites and prints derived paths
- `--dry-run`: prints a preview of the runner invocation
- `--status` / `--artifacts`: summarize generated host artifacts
- `--run`: guarded execution of `bootstrap/runner.sh` (requires explicit env gates)

Next step to make this real:

1. Install optional tools (`tofu`, `terragrunt`, `ansible`)
2. Populate `/root/RALF/.ralf-host/runtime/secrets`
3. Enable targeted stack runs only after validating a safe host-mode workflow (e.g. `RUN_STACKS=0` first, then selected stacks)
